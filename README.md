tbh, I love the Sven style (HD, etc), but sometimes I want back to the good old classic Half-Life models. But I don't like when it's mixed (like, I playing some map and it's have an HD models that doesn't fit into LD vibe), so I decided to start this project. If you wanna contribute it - feel free!

# Sven Co-op Classic Models
This project aims to replace the HD/SD/UD models, sounds, etc with LD analogues. Some I found on the internet (and fixed, ofc), some I grabbed from other mods, some I made myself by analogy with the original models. 
The project itself is an analog of "Nostalgia NPCs" or "All Sven Hands" by Garompa, only here the models are vice versa - getting closer to the original Half-Life style than to the Sven Co-op/Half-Life SD Pack style

Also, fixing the existing ones (fucked up animations, UV shit, etc)

Recommended to use it with Definitive Classic Pack by VitorHunter (https://gamebanana.com/mods/167285)

If you're Server Operator or playing alone/with friends via P2P, also recommended to use with Classic Mode Deluxe by w00tguy (https://github.com/wootguy/ClassicModeDeluxe)

Remember - **No HD** in this pack. Even models that initially was HD(ish) will get a downscaled-pixelated textures and simplified meshes.

You are also allowed to use this content however you want. I don't claim authorship, as most of the models are just taken from different mods and old sven maps. I'm just reworking them.

W.I.P.
