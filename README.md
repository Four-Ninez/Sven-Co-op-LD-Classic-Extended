# Introduction
tbh, I love the Sven style (HD, etc), but sometimes I want back to the good old classic Half-Life models. But I don't like when it's mixed (like, I playing some map and it's have an HD models that doesn't fit into LD vibe), so I decided to start this project.

# Sven Co-op LD Classic Extended
This project aims to replace the HD/SD/UD models, sounds, etc with LD analogues. Some I found on the internet (and fixed, ofc), some I grabbed from other mods, some I made myself by analogy with the original models. 
The project itself is an analog of [Nostalgia NPCs](https://github.com/GarompaEstomper/Nostalgia_NPCs_Pack) or [All Maps with Sven Hands](https://github.com/GarompaEstomper/All_Maps_with_Sven_Hands) by Garompa, only here the models are vice versa - getting closer to the original Half-Life style than to the Sven Co-op/Half-Life SD Pack style. Also, it's a continutation of Definitive Classic Pack by VitorHunter, only this project is aimed at custom assets of custom maps.

Also, fixing the existing ones (fucked up animations, UV shit, etc)

Recommended to use it with [Definitive Classic Pack by VitorHunter](https://gamebanana.com/mods/167285)

If you're Server Operator or playing alone/with friends via P2P, also recommended to use with [Classic Mode Deluxe by w00tguy](https://github.com/wootguy/ClassicModeDeluxe)

Remember - **No HD** in this pack. Even models that initially was HD(ish) will get a downscaled-pixelated textures and simplified meshes.

# Note
You are also allowed to use this content however you want. I don't claim authorship, as most of the models are just taken from different mods and old sven maps. I'm just reworking them.

Also, if you wanna contribute it (add or fix something, etc) - feel free! Just dm me to my discord - fournines
